## Exercise I

a) Whatever n is, it will always run n times...
So, O(n)

b) As n increases, so do the number of operations required to
break the while-loop. It's not so high as n^n, but turns out to be something like n + (n/2) + ((n - 1)/2) + ((n - 2)/2) + ... and so on, until it reaches (n - n).
So, I would say: O(n log(n))

c)
